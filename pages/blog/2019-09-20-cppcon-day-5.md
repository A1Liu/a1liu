Notes for the last day!

## JIT Compilation in C++
-  Halide, ArrayFire, PCRE, ClamAV, OpenCL, Blend2D, TensorFlow
-  Templates force specialization, can't have "fast first tier"
-  They somehow figured out template execution at runtime
   -  Compile with clang -fjit
   -  Compile non-JIT code as usual, convert references to function templates
      to clang-JIT references
-  Binary compilation
-  Compilation time speed up by 7x if ignoring library header compilation time
-  Runtime very slightly reduced in small matrix cases for CPU, runtime vastly
   increased for GPU code
-  Compile-time of Regex vastly increased, but runtime vastly reduced
-  Interesting interaction between reflection & JIT:
   -  You really want to limit object size
   -  Reflection increases amount of stuff that you can read in templates

#### Questions I had
-  How does the dense hashmap deal with multithreaded applications (Mutex)
-  What is the baseline for Eigen header compilation? (1-2 seconds)
-  What's the compile time of the CTRE library without JIT? (???)
-  Is there an option to JIT by default in Clang? (No)
-  Do you think serialization would improve with metaclass support? (Unknown,
   haven't tried it)
-  Did benchmarks of other regular expressions demonstrate same behavior that you
   show here? (Unknown)

## Deprecating Volatile
-  Plenty of weird examples with volatile
-  Mostly about the ambiguity of volatile

## Inclusivity Panel
-  What would be really helpful is having a plenary session about inclusivity
-  "Virtue signalling"

#### Talking to Engineers
-  All engineers have imposter syndrome

<!--
## Debugging
-  `-g` can be done at different levels, `-g3` is highest

## Defragmenting C++: Making Exceptions and RTTI More Affordable and Usable
