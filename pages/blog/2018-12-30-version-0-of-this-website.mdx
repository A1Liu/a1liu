# Version 0 of this Website
It's done! I finished version 0 of this website. It's missing a lot of features, but it's a good enough basic framework that I'm ok with it being done for now.
In the future I'd like to keep working on it and eventually get it to a point where it looks clean, modern, and professional. Maybe by the time I'm out of college? I hope so at least.

#### Snapshot
The last commit for this build of the website is `e63a681699465c43942cb9c5eeddbd3bf0da2e18 - "added short tag"`.
From now on I'm going to separate post writing from building the website, so the next version will be committed to a separate branch and merged into master, while posts will be committed directly to master.
Here's some images of the first build:
