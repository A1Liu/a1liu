### Lessons
*  **Nobody does well alone:** "You're the average of the 5 people you're
   closest to." You only hear about the *one* person, but they have entire
   groups of people helping them succeed.
*  **Manage your expectations:** story about daughter, tooth fairy, american girl doll
*  **Always challenge yourself:** Always asks himself "have I learned something new
   today?"
*  **Iterate fast:** Lots of google products went through major rewrites
*  **Listen to your users:** Don't try to "use AI", try to *solve a problem.*
*  **Diverse teams serve users best:** Gives your team perspective.
   Even if its just awareness of accessibility issues.
   *  Inclusive teams attract diversity
*  **Be persistent:** Keep trying. Make sure that you're persistent. He went
   through like 4 sales jobs lol.
*  **Have fun!** DropBox CEO's dog is always excited about seeing
   his tennis ball, and that's what work should feel like. When you're excited,
   you can do better.

## Intro to Design Thinking {% include back-to-top %}
Design thinking is a fun way to come up with ideas that focuses on listening
and brainstorming.

1. Empathise - Observe, engage, immerse yourself with key audiences
(i.e. target users)
2. Frame - Reframe the initial problem as "a how might we"
based on what you've learned
3. Ideate - No idea is bad. Share ideas and build on top of them.
The goal is quauntity + creativity
4. Prototype - Try building some of these ideas and put them in the real wolrd
5. Test + Repeat - Learn from testing your prototype and repeat till you narrow in

### Workshop Problem
Kids Take Over (KTO) is a media group focused on hip hop. Their viewer demographic
is *1.8% women.* We need to increase female engagement.

1. **Empathise**
   1. Interview with founder
      -  Have you interviewed many female artists? - no I think one and it hasn't
         been posted yet
      -  "Do you read comments?" - Yes.
      -  What do women on your platform watch - There's this one guy that everyone
         watches, but the girls seem to like talk about how hot he is
      -  Why do you want to reach women? - Hip hop isn't a male-dominated market,
         so missing out on girls means missing a part of the market
      -  Why do you think you aren't reaching women? - 
      -  Why haven't you interviewed many female artists? - I live in Vancouver,
         not many women artists come over, and the ones that do are a little out
         of my league
      -  What are your shows? - Facetime series, one-on-one series, behind the
         scenes series
      -  What have you done to advertise so far? - Instagram, 22% female that
         watch, but advertising is targeted to men rn
   2. Questioning with Amanda
      -  Do you like hip hop? - Yes
      -  Who do you like? - I find it through spotify discover; people like Drake,
         Frank ocean
      -  How do you find new stuff? - Instagram influencers
2. **Frame**
   1. How might we advertise to women better? - do the facetime thing with female
      hip-hop instagram influencers.
   2. Keep it to questions and not to solutions
3. **Ideate** -> crazy eights, which is an eight minute thing where you come up
   with 8 ideas on eight sections of paper.
   1. More female artists
   2. Targeted ads
   3. Spotify podcast
   4. Facetime with female artists
   5. Merch
   6. More hot guys
   7. Talk to other groups that have had trouble getting the female demographic
   8. Instagram influencers
4. ... Out of time

## Laying the Fundation to your CS Career {% include back-to-top %}
Focus on the technical interview.

### Building your skills
*  Freshman year
   *  At least one CS & Math course
   *  Object oriented programming language
   *  Understanding of formal logic
   *  Read & understand existing code
   *  CS clubs/societies
   *  Hackathons
   *  Open source, Web/Mobile apps
   *  Personal projects
*  Sophomore year
   *  Proficiency in at least one Programming language
   *  Data Structures and Algorithms
   *  Personal/collaborative CS Projects

### Tech Interview Prep
**Format**
1. Short intro - 5 min
2. Tech assessment - 35 min
3. Closing questions - 5 min

#### Communication

**Verbalize your thoughts**
* Restate questions
* Ask questions
* think out loud
* Draw pictures
* If you think in silence, summarize

**Listen to your interviewer**
* They want you to succeed
* Session is a discussion
* They might be hinting you

#### Phone interviews
* Quiet location
* Use Courier New for coding
* Use headphones
* Have pen/paper reader
* Share thoughts out loud
* Remember to manually indent
* Don't search for references/the question

#### Common Mistakes

**Jumping into code**
*  Care more about process than solution
*  Interviewer won't know if you're headed down bad path
*  May not be able to offer hints
*  May run out of time if you need to start over

**Examples/testing**
*  Discuss test verbally first
*  Pick a simple example
*  Think about an edge case or two
*  Analyze runtime/space complexity
*  Don't forget to test your code
*  Don't waste too much time with too many examples

**Not writing real code**
*  Use pseudocode only if the interviewer is ok with it
*  Helper functions are unimplemented, not pseudocode
*  No pseudocode in solution
*  Keep pseudocode and real code separate

**Premature optimization**
*  Think critically about the algorithmic complexity
*  Explain why it isn't possible to improve it
*  Be OK starting with the brute force solution!
*  You can verbalize a simple solution first, then iterate on it!

#### Practice Questions
**1.** Coding question: reading code.

```java
public static boolean f(int[] arr) {
  if (arr == null || arr.length == 0) return false;
  boolean x = false;
  int y = arr[0];
  for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (x && arr[i] == y) {
      return true;
    } else if (arr[i] == y) {
      x = true;
    } else P
      y = arr[i];
      x = false;
  }
  return false;
}
```

What does the above do? Can we rewrite it more readably?

```java
public static boolean hasTriplet(int[] array) {
  if (array == null || array.length < 3) return false;
  for (int i = 0, prev; i < array.length - 2; i++) {
    // There's lots of different ways to do this.
  }
  return false;
}
```

**2.** Write a method that when given an array of integers returns true if any of
the values make a double decker. A value is considered a double decker if it
appears 3 times in with an alternating second value (a, b, a, b, a).

*  Q: What if input is null or less than five?
   A: Return false

```python
# [3, 4, 3, 4, 3] returns true
# [3, 4, 3, 3, 3] returns true

def has_double_decker(array):
    if array is None or len(array) < 5:
        return False
    for index in range(len(array) - 5):
        if _section_double_decker(array[index:index+5]):
            return True
    return False

def _section_double_decker(array):
    assert len(array) == 5
    return     array[0] == array[2] \
           and array[2] == array[4] \
           and array[1] == array[3]
```

**Final Tips**
*  No shortcuts
*  Err on the side of caution and over communication
*  Test your code!
*  Read all emails from top to bottom
*  Answer all questions and provide all requested information
*  Schedule time to speak with your recruiter as needed
*  Respond to emails quickly
*  Tell your recruiter about offer deadlines, recruiting deadlines, major updates,
   or just email them if you haven't heard from them in a while

**Q & A**
*  What do you do in the case of a bad interviewer? - Hopefully it doesn't happen,
   but it shouldn't be that bad because there are multiple interviewers per
   candidate
*  If I've never worked at a tech company, how can I learn the software development
   cycle? - The Engineering Practicum is a good start. You could try reading about
   AGILE software development, or asking friends that have done it. Also, you
   could do your own projects and learn about that stuff from doing it
*  How do you keep yourself motivated? - Make sure you take breaks, but if you
   like coding it shouldn't be too big of a deal. But really make sure you take]
   breaks.
