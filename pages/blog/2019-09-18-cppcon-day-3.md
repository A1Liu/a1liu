Here's my notes for day 3!

## WebAssembly and C++
-  `repl.it`
-  Clang in browser
-  JSLinux
-  Wasm is validated before execution

## Homework
I ended up doing a bit of homework today. I wasn't that excited about the talks
that were available today, and more importantly I realized I have very little
quite a bit of homework I still have to do for next week, so I decided to just
take some time to make sure I'm caught up on stuff. I ended up spending quite a
bit of time organizing stuff for BUGS as well.

## Tired
This conference is tiring. I spent the vast majority of the afternoon and
evening sleeping, doing homework, and just relaxing. I still think it was worth
the time.
