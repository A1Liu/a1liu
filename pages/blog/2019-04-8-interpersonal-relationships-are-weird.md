Today I found out I'm an asshole. Or I guess, more accurately, I found out that
one of my roommate's friends sees me as an asshole. I'm not exactly sure how to
feel about it, but I figure it's something that I can try to learn from regardless.

First, some background. My roommate's friends are basically all smokers, and had
gotten into the habit of smoking in my room. Recently I've been more and more
unhappy with this behavior; I'm not a smoker, and it seems like my breathing has
just gotten worse as more people smoke in my room. In the past 2 weeks I've tried
to ask them to stop, sometimes by asking my roommate to stop, other times by asking
his friends to. I'm not sure how pushy I am when I do that, but I don't think
I'm that unreasonable when I talk to George (my roommate); he seems pretty understanding
and my voice doesn't change from an even, quiet tone.

Anyways, today I asked one of George's friends, Diego, to not smoke, and I must have been
confrontational, because he wasn't understanding at all. Diego immediately
tensed up a little, and retorted with a "Why'd you have to be so disrespectful?
See if you had asked nicely, I would've stopped, but you didn't," and continued
to light a cigarette and take a puff. He then continued by saying "if you respect
me, I'll respect you," or something like that. Meanwhile, another friend of George,
Christian, was warning Diego to disengage: "Dude he gets pissy about that shit,
just don't smoke in here it's not worth it. He's a douchebag." Christian and Diego
then go to smoke in Christian's room (which is a door over from mine).

I'm not sure what to take from that interaction. There's a few things that I'm pretty
sure are true:

*  Diego, Christian, and many of George's other friends see smoking as a normal
   part of life, and not being able to do it is an inconvenience
*  Diego is used to a certain amount of respect and leniency with the things he does.
   i.e. being able to smoke indoors, mess with peoples' stuff, etc.
*  Christian sees me as neurotic, and also pissy.

Was I at fault? It doesn't _feel_ like it. From Diego's perspective, I think the following
thoughts happened:

*  I'm going to smoke
*  Someone told me not to smoke
*  Why can't I smoke? Who do they think they are?

For sure, I don't think he was thinking about the health problems of smoking, or
how I'm the one that lives in the room, or that he could literally just smoke
in the room accross the hall. Additionally, I think Christian was thinking something
along these lines:

*  I don't wanna deal with this
*  Albert's annoying
*  I better warn Diego

Maybe "annoying" is the wrong word, but I don't think I've ever heard Christian
say "neurotic" before, so I don't think he'd think in terms of neuroticism. Regardless,
I think Christian doesn't like me, and potentially blames me for not being able to smoke
in my room as much anymore.

I think there's a lesson here somewhere; maybe something along the lines of "you
can't be friends with everyone" or maybe something more like "some people are just dicks."
I don't think I'm to blame for this, and I don't think I was that much more confrontational
to Diego than anybody else would be in my place. I don't remember raising my voice to ask him to not smoke,
but I do remember scrunching my brows in consternation as he retorted back. Maybe I should
stop doing that. Regardless, I guess it's just OK to not be friends with people;
you can't win over everyone, no matter what you do, and sometimes something as small
as smoking indoors can destroy a potential friendship. Interpersonal relationships
are weird.
