# Todo
- `programs/neovim/init.vim` -> should paths care about `/` vs `\`?
- `shell/env` -> WTF do we do about `/etc/zshenv` and whatnot?
- `install/?` -> M1 needs to handle HomeBrew `$PATH` properly, i.e. `usr/local/bin`
  and `opt/homebrew/bin` before `/bin` (or something like that, idk tbh)
- `install/setup` -> reorganize, maybe just turn it into docs instead of scripts
