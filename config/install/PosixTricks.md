# Posix Tricks

## Hostname Aliases
The file `etc/hosts` allows you to alias hosts, so that local development is
easier. For example, you can alias `schedge.local` to `127.0.0.1`, and then
when you write the full URL in your browser, it'll learn to auto-complete the
full URL, including the port number.
