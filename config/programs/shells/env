# TODO for some godawful reason this shit gets kinda ruined on rerun, because of
# "system configs". Some idiot thought it would be smart to just, tack on the
# system paths in front of everything else, unconditionally, at shell startup,
# so now I have no idea which ones of these will get repeated, and also have no
# idea which order they'll come in. For now this can be ignored, but it's really
# stupid, so if PATH gets fucked up this is the first thing to blame. Look in
# /etc/zshenv, /etc/zprofile, /etc/zlogin and make sure they don't screw up
# the configs

# TODO This also breaks when TMUX runs things. I think I'm going to rewrite this stuff
# to just not append ever, but on install it copies the existing environment.
