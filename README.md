# Configurations
My configurations! This repo represents the things that I like to keep constant between systems; things like
application settings, file organizations, etc.

### TODO
* [ ] Scripts to move stuff around w/ symbolic links
* [ ] More cross-platform compatibility
* [x] Zsh settings
* [ ] Replace agenda on left with rust program that provides rolling schedule
  for next 12 hours, and also skips time if nothing's happening: use
  `gcalcli --tsv agenda --details calendar --details length` for input
